# rosshow

Displays PointCloud2, Imu, and NavSatFix sensor messages in a useful fashion using Unicode Braille art in the terminal so you don't need to fire up rviz. Currently very preliminary (pre-pre-pre-alpha) with many more features and data types to come.

Usage:
```
./rosshow <topicname>
```

## PointCloud2
